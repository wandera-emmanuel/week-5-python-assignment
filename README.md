# File Handling & Error Management 🖋️🧪

## Overview
This Python program performs basic **file handling** and **error management** operations. It:
- Reads the contents of a user-specified file.
- Modifies the content by converting it to uppercase (as an example).
- Writes the modified content to a new file.
- Gracefully handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.

## Features
